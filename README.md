## Introduction

Flexi is an ***ability system framework*** for Unity.

While Flexi has done the general low-level logic:

- Programmers can directly jump into **creating the _gameplay ability system_**.
- Programmers can ***customize*** their task nodes and dicide how they work with the game.
- Then designers can use the ***built-in editor*** to edit ability data.
- The game finally runs abilities with the ***built-in runner***.

P.S. Yes, it's inspired from **[Unreal GAS (Gameplay Ability System)](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/gameplay-ability-system-for-unreal-engine/)**, but Flexi is created with different concept.

## Features

- **Customizable**: Focus on your gameplay with user-defined stats, nodes, logics, events, etc.
- **Actor**: Base class to hold the stats, abilities and modifiers
- **Built-in ability runners**: Start from easy and not make your hands dirty
- **Node-based ability editor**: Built with GraphView and UIToolkit
- **Blackboard**: Seperate values from graphs and inject from other sources
- **Non-singleton approach**: You can have multiple and different systems simutaneously
- ~~**Macro**: Reuse your partial graphs~~ (Failed to find GC free approach. Suspend until main feature finished.)
